# **Vayura - Breathe Smart. Live Clean.**

## **About the Application**

Vayura is my own project which I developed to learn about APIs usage and about building SaaS applications.

The name **Vayura** is inspired by _Vayu_, the Indian god of air which is spot-on name for this application.

The application delivers **real-time air quality data** using the **Open-Meteo API**.

Additionally, Vayura suggests **actionable steps** you can take to reduce the effects of poor air quality on your health.

## **Feedback & Support**

I know that this application isn't perfect, there are a lot of other application but It's just my first 100% build project, with everything that I could think of. I'm willing to learn how to create SaaS (Software as a service) applications.
