# **Vayura - Breathe Smart. Live Clean.**

## **About the Application**

Vayura is a personal side project I developed to deepen my understanding of APIs and enhance my programming skills on my journey to becoming a software developer.

The name **Vayura** is inspired by _Vayu_, the Indian god of air, reflecting the appâ€™s focus on air quality and well-being.

As a young adult, I am deeply concerned about the impact of air pollution on our health. Without clean air, maintaining good health is impossible. Thatâ€™s why I created **Vayura**â€”an application that provides **real-time air quality data** using the **Open-Meteo API**.

Additionally, Vayura suggests **actionable steps** you can take to reduce the effects of poor air quality on your health.
